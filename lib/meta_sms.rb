# This module is use to send sms through sms providers as sms box.
# It contains a class method #send_sms which takes a hash as argument.
# #send_sms will send sms, log sms if logging is enabled ((in options or config.logging) and migrations_for_logger is generated and migrated.)
# Some inportant classes of module MetaSms are:
# => Config
# Config is for containg the config variables required in the process of sending sms and logging results in db.
# => SmsProviderSelector
# MetaSms#send_sms uses SmsProviderSelector class to select the provider from the given lists of provider in the gem
# on the basis of the configuration variable, sms_provider_name.
# => ISmsProvider
# It acts as an interface for all the providers. So, in order to use sms provider class, we shall create an object
# of sms provider, which in turn use the constructor of ISmsProvider. This constructor takes options as an argument.
# options is a hash in which :message_text and :mobile_number is the required keys. Other optional keys can be
# :logging, :metadata. Here, :message_text will be the message sen to the user with mobile number as :mobile_number.
# :logging represents whether logging of this message is required in the database or not. There is a config variable
# logging, which also determines the same. So, logging will be true, if any of these value is true. :metadata can be
# any json data that client wants to save in the db along with the log.
# => Smsbox
# Smsbox is the sms provider class. It will have a method send_sms, which overrides the method of its parent class, ISmsProvider.
# Smsbox.send_sms will send message if required options and required configuration variable are present else, it will
# raise error. MetaSms#send_sms will rescue the error, write the log and then throw the rescued error.
# @note Here error from sms_logging is not handled.
# => SmsLogging
# This is an active record responsible to log data into database. It will save the sms log into a sms_loggings table.
# SmsLogging#log_sms is the method which does saving job. This method will raise StandardError if
# config.logging or options[:logging] is true and you have not executed, 'rails g meta_sms:migrations_for_logger'.
